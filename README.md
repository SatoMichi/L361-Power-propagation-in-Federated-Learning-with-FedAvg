This is a repository for L361 final project.

### Code
Some code and implementation are from 
- https://github.com/mysistinechapel/powerprop
- class lab notebook of the L361 course

### Notes
- femnist data need to be download for running experiments

- If you want to run the experiment, we will suggest using small epochs, clients_per_round, and rounds since the experiment will took time
